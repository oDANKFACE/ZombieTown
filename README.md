# Overview

"Zombie Town" is a basic action-reaction text-based game, reminiscent of Choose Your Own Adventure books. It is my
first dive into C++. My goal was to learn the basics of C++ and then double down on it by thinking of a project that I
would have no idea how to tackle, and that's how I landed on this textual interactive project. The project pushed me to
constantly run into scenarios that I had no idea how to approach, and then begin the process of digging for answers.

# Development Environment

I used the JetBrains CLion IDE for this project. The game was coded in C++, I used several std:: libraries and the
nlohmann/json library to construct this program.
